Selected Projects
------
**Amplitude Changes of Rossby Waves in the Northern Hemisphere and Their Influencing Factors 2023.03-present**  
National College Students innovation and entrepreneurship training program  
Participated in as the second-ranked member. The amplitude of Rossby waves has an important impact on the occurrence of extreme weather. In this project, we use Fourier decomposition and the core isertel to describe the amplitude and investigate the impact of climate change and greenhouse effects on the amplitude. The project is currently in the middle stage, and in the early stages, I was responsible for using ERA5 data, using Fourier decomposition to calculate the amplitude of Rossby waves and drawing graphs.  
**Air Pollution Simulation and prediction in Lanzhou based on Machine Learning 2022.03-2023.03**  
Lanzhou University innovation and entrepreneurship training program  
Leader. I led this project from proposal to completion, including the writing of the final paper. This project used historical national monitoring data and was compiled using Python. Two machine learning methods, Random Forest and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), were used to predict the AQI (air quality index) in Lanzhou city. We adopted a method of selecting monthly fluctuation thresholds to merge the results of the two models, and analyzed the air quality situation in Lanzhou over a long time series of 20 years.  
**Quality Control and Evaluation of Raw Aircraft Observation Data 2021.03-2022.03**  
Lanzhou University innovation and entrepreneurship training program  
Participated in. Collected literature, processed and grouped data, assisted in drawing figures and be responsible for the first two parts of the article.  
**The Carbon Emissions Accounting Report for Yuzhong Campus 2023.02**  
Coursework. Based on the 'Guidelines for Accounting and Reporting of Greenhouse Gas Emissions in Other Industries in China (Trial)' issued by the Chinese government, we make a 20-page report. The report includes an introduction, verification process and methods, verification findings, and verification conclusions. The relevant data came from public announcements by the finance department of Lanzhou University and data provided by professors. This coursework received a score of 95.
